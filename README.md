# Hangman-CLI

Command Line Interface Hangman Game 

Overview: 
This project incorporates JavaScript's brand of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) by using constructors and the prototype chain. 
This project is a creation of a hangman command-line game using constructor functions. 

The game receives user input using the prompt npm package. 
A word and letter constructor files were made. 
The game keeps track of the user's remaining guesses and prompts the user if they would like to end the game if none remain. 
Each constructor function is in it's own file and is exported and required where needed. 

This project utilizes JavaScript, Git Bash, and prompt npm package.
